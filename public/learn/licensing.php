<h2>Cappuccino &amp; Objective-J Licensing Information</h2>

<p>Cappuccino is two things: the set of frameworks, namely AppKit and Foundation, collectively known as Cappuccino; and the open source project hosted at this site containing those frameworks, as well as the Objective-J programming language.</p>

<p>Cappuccino, the project and its components, is released as free software under the terms of the <a href="lgpl.txt">LGPL version 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>Under the LGPL, you're free to use this code in your own software, whether that software is open source or not.  If you make modifications to either Cappuccino or Objective-J, you're required to release those changes under the LGPL.  You are not required to release other parts of your program that merely use Cappuccino or Objective-J.</p>

<p>Practically, this means that nearly all users of Cappuccino and Objective-J will never need to open source any code they write.  The required licensing and copyright information is distributed with the software, so most people won't need to do anything at all to comply with our license.</p>
            
<p>If you have questions about licensing issues, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:developers@280north.com">developers@280north.com</a> and we will do our best to help.</p>
