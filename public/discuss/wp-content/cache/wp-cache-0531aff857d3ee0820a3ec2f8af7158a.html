		<description>The Link called "API Documentation" gives 404.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The correct link is here &lt;a href="http://cappuccino.org/learn/documentation/class_c_p_u_r_l_connection.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://cappuccino.org/learn/documentation/class...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delete this comment if the document gets fixed.</description>

		<description>Yes it adds script elements, and then later removes them. Its possible this leaks in IE, but its also possible that only happens if you "leak" references to event handlers. I believe we correctly clean these up.</description>

		<description>Adding and removing the &#60;script /&#62; elements seems to leak memory in IE. Does the JSONP technique just add &#60;script /&#62; elements to the DOM?</description>

		<description>I haven&#39;t tested it with polling, but there&#39;s no reason it shouldn&#39;t work. It was designed with the ability to make arbitrary requests at arbitrary times. There&#39;s no guarantee about what order the responses will come in, but with a five second interval they will probably come in the right order, and its also trivial to manage this yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t have any specifics about browser memory characteristics using JSONP versus a regular xml http request, but I would image they are fairly similar.</description>

		<description>Nice job. I wanted to comment about using CPJSONPConnection class for accomplishing cross domain communications. I&#39;ve built a chat web app that&#39;s loaded within one domain but communicates with a subdomain. I&#39;ve implemented a polling messaging technique to inform the user of any messages that they&#39;ve received. Have you tested using the CPJSONPConnection class in a situation where the app has to make multiple requests (5 seconds apart)? Do you have any ideas about the browser memory usage when using the &#60;script /&#62; tag technique?</description>
