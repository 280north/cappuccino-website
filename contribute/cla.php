<h1>Contributors License Agreement</h1>

<p>In an effort to make it more easy for everyone to comply with our Contributors License Agreement, 
we've made it available online for digital signature. The old text based form is 
<a href="cla.txt">still available</a> if you prefer, the content remains the same.
The contents of this agreement are based on the CLA from the Apache Software Foundation.</p>

<h2>Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") V1.0</h2>     

<p>Thank you for your interest in open source software provided by 
280 North, Inc. (the "Company"). In order to clarify the 
intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any 
person or entity, the Company must have a Contributor License 
Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, 
indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for 
your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the 
Company, the open source project, and its users; it does not change 
your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. If 
you have not already done so, please complete and submit the form below. 
Please read this document carefully before signing and print a copy for 
your records.</p>

<p><strong>Fill out this form, read the agreement, and submit at the bottom of the page.</strong></p>

<p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
present and future Contributions submitted to the Company. Except
for the license granted herein to the Company and recipients of
software distributed by the Company, You reserve all right, title,
and interest in and to Your Contributions.</p>

<p>1. Definitions. "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
   authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
   with the Company. For legal entities, the entity making a
   Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
   by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
   be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
</p>

<p>"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,
   including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
   is intentionally submitted by You to the Company for inclusion
   in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by
   the Company (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
   "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
   communication sent to the Company or its representatives,
   including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
   lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
   are managed by, or on behalf of, the Company for the purpose of
   discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that
   is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You
   as "Not a Contribution."
</p>
    
<p>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to
   recipients of software distributed by the Company a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
   Contributions and such derivative works.</p>

<p>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to
   recipients of software distributed by the Company a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
   made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
   Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
   licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any
   entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
   that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,
   constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
   patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for
   that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.
</p>

<p>4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
   license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property
   that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent
   that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf
   of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for
   your Contributions to the Company, or that your employer has
   executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Company.</p>

<p>5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
   creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).  You
   represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
   details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
   but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you
   are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
   Contributions.
</p>

<p>6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
   except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
   support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
   applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
   Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
   OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
   INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
</p>

<p>7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
   You may submit it to the Company separately from any
   Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of
   any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
   related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you
   are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
   "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".
</p>

<p>8. You agree to notify the Company of any facts or circumstances of
   which you become aware that would make these representations
   inaccurate in any respect.
